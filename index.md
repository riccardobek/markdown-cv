## About me
I'm a friendly, determined and scrupulous guy.
I consider myself available and open to any suggestion, always looking for the smartest solutions for solving problems.

Since I wrote the first "Hello world" in HTML, the creation of web applications has always fascinated me. I know various programming languages, but I'm always ready to learn new ones (my favourites are Javascript and Typescript).

In my first working experience I discovered the potential of SPA frameworks so much that I decided to learn Angular by myself and to take the initiative to apply it to a work-related project (which has been very successful). 

Everyday I like to find space for myself, having a break dedicated to read manga or keep me updated on the latest IT related stuff.
